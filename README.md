Entry for  and the Seattle HOGJam.

### Description

Crush 3 was developed simultaneously for two 48-hour game jams â€” the Bacon Game Jam (theme: Rainbow) and the Seattle-based HOGJam (theme: Persevere). The game can be described as a cross between Bejeweled, Tetris, and everything you've ever loved.

You need to be warned now: Crush 3 is like a potato chip. Once you take a bite, you won't be able to stop until you've thrown your controller into your monitor in beautiful frustration. Play with a friend if you don't really like that friend and don't want them to be your friend anymore!
